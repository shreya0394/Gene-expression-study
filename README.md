# Gene-expression-study
The provided repository includes gene expression analysis of UBR7, a protein that modifies Sp110, impacting the body's natural defence mechanisms and leading to the prolonged presence of  hepatitis B virus (HBV). This, in turn, contributes to the development of liver cancer induced by HBV. The study utilized data from NCBI GEO with accession number GSE229339 and was conducted using  R language, employing various libraries such as GEOquery, ggplot2, tidyverse, and dplyr
